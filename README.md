# Verilog_Designs
* Verilog is a HARDWARE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE (HDL). 
* It is a language used for describing a digital system like a network switch or a microprocessor or a memory or a flipâˆ’flop. It means, by using a HDL we can describe any digital hardware at any level. 
* Designs, which are described in HDL are independent of technology, very easy for designing and debugging, and are normally more useful than schematics, particularly for large circuits.
