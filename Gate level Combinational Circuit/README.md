* Combinational circuits are developed using AND, OR, NOT, NAND, and NOR logic gates. 
* These logic gates are building blocks of combinational circuits. A combinational circuit consists of input variables and output variables. 
* Since these circuits are not dependent upon previous input to generate any output, so are combinational logic circuits. 
* A combinational circuit can have an n number of inputs and m number of outputs. 
* In combinational circuits, the output at any time is a direct function of the applied external inputs.
