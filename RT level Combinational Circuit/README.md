* A combinational circuit, by definition, is a circuit whose output, after the initial transient period, is a function of current input.
* It has no internal state and therefore is “memoryless” about the past event (or past inputs).
* A register transfer level (RTL) design consists of a set of registers connected by combinational logic.
